The theme of my site is hiking bag store, I have researched many sites to get inspiration and this is the one I like the most.



I added a navbar that is fixed, which means that when I scroll it will always be there.

Then we have the homepage, here I added an image related to this topic and I added a title and a button that leads to the shop.

The second section consists of an image and another button that leads to the shop.

The third section consists of 3 pictures where I have put the types of bags we have on offer.

The fourth section consists of new bags that have arrived and we have a button that leads to the shop.

The fifth section is a description of the site.

In the sixth section, there is a form that the user can fill out and contact information.

And at the end of the page there is a footer.

In navbar we can go to other pages such as (shop, groups, terms and shipping).


The store has all the bags that are in stock.

In groups there is something about group hiking.

We also have terms and conditions and shipping & returns, that's just some information.


As for the decoration, I used bootstrap and css, and I added 2 functions in javascript to the sidebar (it's the menu at a lower resolution).

I used images from Pexels, Montserat font and google some google icons
